# Written Analysis of PyBer Fare by City Type
working with python and matlplotlib

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between PyBer fare costs and the city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). By merging city and driver datasets provided by PyBer, the results show that in rural city types the average cost of a ride is much higher than urban and suburban city types. 

### Results
Looking at the results of the PyBer_Summary_df, we can see that the Total number of rides and drivers increases in urban and suburban city types, yet the average fare per ride and average fare per driver decreases. Meaning that it may be very difficult to get a ride if you live in a rural area and it will cost more as a rider.

When looking at the results of the multiline chart titled, "Total Fare by City Type" we can see the significant difference in the fare amounts between city types based on a monthly view. This shows that in this given date range, rural and suburban city types still remain lower throughout the year with one significant peak in the third week of March for all three city types.

### Summary
Based on the information gathered from this analysis, three business recommendations for PyBer is as follows:
* Increase the incentives for drivers to work in more rural areas so there are more drivers available for ride requesters.
* Decrease the fare amount for riders in rural areas in order to stay competitive. If the average cost of using PyBer's services is more than competition (public transit or personal vehicles), riders will choose the cheaper alternative.
* Take advantage of peak pricing in urban areas. When there is a date or time that has historically been very busy for drivers, increase the cost for riders. In rural areas, offer very low fare pricing during less busy periods (opposite peak pricing) to incentivize riders to use PyBer's services.
